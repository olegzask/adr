        "The most important factor to consider in shopping for a dash camera is image resolution. Recording at 2K QHD at 30 frames/second, the Momento M7 provides the clearest picture we have to offer. In the event of a collision or dispute on the road, the M7 will provide crucial video evidence with clear details (license plates, faces, time, GPS) to protect you.",
        "With the roads getting crazier every day, there has never been a better time to invest in a dash camera system. The Momento M7 is an all-in-one dash camera system that adds discreet, surveillance-grade cameras at the front and rear of your vehicle to protect you from break-ins, hit-and-runs, and collision fraud.",
        "Momento M7 introduces “Eco Mode” – our new battery-saving technology. When Eco Mode is activated while parked, your M7 dash camera uses radar to detect motion, instead of the image sensor – cutting battery consumption by up to 90%! This protects your vehicle’s battery while keeping your front camera active.",
        "The Momento M7 front camera utilizes a SmartSens AI-Series image sensor, which was designed for surveillance applications in all lighting conditions. So whether you are driving at night or parked in a shared parking garage, M7 will dynamically adjust exposure and white balance to capture an optimized picture.",
        "Unlike our competitors, Momento M7 includes both front and rear cameras, giving you comprehensive surveillance around your vehicle. The M7 even has an additional video input to add a third camera, such as the IC6 interior camera.",
        "Our most advanced dash camera is also our easiest to use! The M7 front camera has a built-in LCD for reviewing footage, starting recordings, and configuring your dash camera system. But don’t worry about distracted driving as the LCD will go to sleep while you are driving.",
        "Momento M7 is our first dash camera to feature three video channels. By default, the front and rear cameras occupy channels 1 and 2. For the third video input, Momento offers the IC6 interior camera.",
        "Equipped with IR LEDs for night vision, the IC6 is the perfect accessory for rideshare or fleet applications.",
